# **Snake Game in Python (Pygame)**

This repository contains the implementation of the classic **Snake Game** in Python, built using the **Pygame** module. The game is a simple recreation where the player controls the movement of a snake to collect food items, and the snake grows longer with each food item eaten. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.

## **Game Description**
The **Snake Game** involves controlling a snake on the screen, which moves continuously in a direction chosen by the player. The objective is to guide the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen. With each food item consumed, the snake grows longer. The player must avoid colliding with the edges of the screen or the snake's own body, which results in the game being over.

## **How to Play**
- Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to control the movement of the snake.
- The game continues until the snake hits the walls or itself.
- Your score increases with every food item the snake eats.
- The game restarts when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
